# Module 19 Class 1: Introduction to Advanced Machine Learning

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing you to neural networks and deep learning. In this unit, you will compare the machine learning classification and regression models from previous modules with the neural network models used in this module. Then,you’ll use TensorFlow to implement neural networks and deep neural networks across a number of different datasets, including image, natural language, and numerical datasets. 

In today's class, you will review neural networks, the perceptron neural network model, and the components of a basic neural network. Then, you’ll use the TensorFlow Playground to explore the components of a neural network and how each component interacts with others. Finally, you’ll set up Google Colaboratory to execute “cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks” and build your own neural network model. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Understand how unsupervised learning compares to supervised learning
* Prepare and process data for unsupervised learning
* Apply K-means clustering
* Use the elbow curve to determine optimal cluster number

## How does this tie into the modules?

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **19.0.1: The Rise of Machine Learning** through **19.2.3: Train and Test a Basic Neural Network**.  The students will benefit from these activities if they‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Understanding the concept of a neural network
* Understanding the concept of the perceptron model
* Using the TensorFlow Playground to understand a neural network and change its performance
* Installing TensorFlow 
* Building a basic neural network 
* Predicting the classification of data from a trained neural network
  
## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?
