# Module 7 Class 2: Filtering with Joins

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Perform SQL queries using `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`
* Perform SQL queries using aggregate functions 
* Perform SQL queries using multiple joins to filter data

## How does this tie into the modules?
The activities in this class will complement Lessons **7.3.4: Use Count, Group By, and Order By** through **7.3.6: Create a Tailored List**.  The students will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Use the `COUNT()` function in a SQL query
* Group and order data in a SQL query
* Use joins to combine records from two or more tables
* Filter SQL queries using multiple joins with the `WHERE` clause

## Where can I go in the modules for assistance?

 * Creating a database was covered in **Lesson 7.2.1**.
  * Creating tables in a database was covered in **Lesson 7.2.2**.
  * Importing data into tables was covered in **Lesson 7.2.3**.
  * The `COUNT` function was covered in **Lesson 7.2.4**.
  * The `DISTINCT ON ()` statement was covered in the **07-Stu_Distinct_Queries** activity and will be needed to complete the Challenge.
