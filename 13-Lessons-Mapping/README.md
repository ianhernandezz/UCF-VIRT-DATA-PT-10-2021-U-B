## What You Will Learn
In this module, you will use the Leaflet.js Application Programming Interface (API) to populate a geographical map with GeoJSON earthquake data from a URL. Each earthquake will be visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake will have a popup marker that, when clicked, will show the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake.

To be successful in this module, you'll need to be familiar with HTML and basic JavaScript.

* Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
* Add, commit, and push data to a GitHub branch.
* Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
* Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
* Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
* Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
* Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
* Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
* Render maps on a local server.
