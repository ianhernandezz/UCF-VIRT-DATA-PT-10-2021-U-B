# Module 13 Class 2: Mapping GeoJSON Data

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Use external GeoJSON data to populate a map
* Modify the layer controls to add interactivity to maps

## How does this tie into the modules?
The activities in this class will complement Lessons **13.5.1: Overview of GeoJSON Data** through **13.6.5: Add a Legend to the Map**. You will benefit from these activities if you have progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Read GeoJSON data with the `d3json()` method
* Create maps from GeoJSON data with `L.geoJSON()`
* Access different types of geographical features in the GeoJSON file
* Use a `baseMaps` object to reference a base layer
* Create multiple overlays for our maps


## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?

  * Mapping GeoJSON data was covered in **Lessons 13.5.1 through 13.5.6**.
  * Mapping earthquake data was covered in **Lesson 13.6.1**.
  * Adding a style to the map was covered in **Lesson 13.6.2**.
  * Adding color to the map was covered in **Lesson 13.6.3**.
  * Adding an additional overlay was covered in **Lesson 13.6.4**.
