## Overview
This week, we will be using the Python library SQLAlchemy to connect to a SQL database, retrieve data into Python objects, create a Flask API web app, and connect to the app to render data on a webpage. You'll spend time with new tools such as SQLite, SQLAlchemy, and Flask to build on your knowledge of SQL database structures and querying methods. You'll also write and execute Python code in a Jupyter notebook and create graphs using Python.

## What You Will Learn
