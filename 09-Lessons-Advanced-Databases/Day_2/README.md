# Module 9 Class 2: Working with Flask to Create a Web Application 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Connect to a database using SQLAlchemy
* Use Flask to create and run a server 
* Retrieve data from a database using GET requests
* Execute database queries on behalf of the client
* Return jsonified query results from API endpoints and populate a webpage 


## How does this tie into the modules?
The activities in this class will complement Lessons **9.4.1: Incorporate Flask into Data Analysis** through **9.5.6: Statistics Route**. The students will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Create a Flask web application with API routes
* Jsonify data from a SQL database
* Render jsonified data to a webpage through the Flask application


# Where in the modules can I go for assistance?
  * Plotting data from a SQLAlchemy query was covered in **Lesson 9.3.4**.
  * Creating a Flask app was covered in **Lesson 9.4.3**.
  * Running a Flask app was covered in **Lesson 9.4.3**.
  * Creating API routes was covered in **Lesson 9.4.3** and **Lessons 9.5.3-9.5.6**. 

# NOTE: please complete **Lesson 10.1.1: Install Your Tools** before next week so you don't have to install splinter, webdriver manager, bs4, and Mongo in class.
