# Module 11 Class 2: JavaScript Objects and DOM Manipulation

## Overview

The main areas of focus for today's class are to have you access, create, update, and iterate over JavaScript objects, use JavaScript to populate and filter data structures based on user input, and apply these changes to a webpage using the `D3.js` library to dynamically manipulate DOM elements. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class,you will be able to:

* Use `forEach()` and callback functions
* Create, update, and iterate JavaScript objects.
* Understand the basic structure of a Bootstrap HTML table
* Use `D3.js` for basic DOM manipulation
* Populate and filter tables using static data structures
* Use D3 to attach events to DOM elements
* Dynamically manipulate the DOM through events

## How does this tie into the modules?
The activities in this class will complement Lessons **11.5.1: Introduction to Dynamic Tables** through **11.6.3: Customize the Page with CSS**. You will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Using `forEach()` and callback functions
* Creating, updating, and iterating over JavaScript objects
* Attach and manipulate the DOM with `D3.js`

## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?
