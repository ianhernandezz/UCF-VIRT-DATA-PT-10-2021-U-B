# Module 11 Class 1: JavaScript Fundamentals

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing the JavaScript programming language. In this unit, you will learn how to use JavaScript objects and arrays, including how to store and retrieve your data.

In today's class, you will initialize variables and determine their data types, perform calculations, and use JavaScript functions and conditional statements to retrieve data from arrays and objects.  

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:
 
* Understand the basics of JavaScript
* Understand the different types of variables and objects in JavaScript
* Create and use JavaScript functions
* Convert JavaScript functions to arrow functions
* Use repetition and conditional statements

## How does this tie into the modules?
The activities in this class will complement Lessons **11.0.1: Creating Dynamic Content** through **11.4.2: Practice Using for Loops in JavaScript**.  You will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Using the Chrome console. 
* Initializing variables, `var`, `let`,`const`, and arrays
* Understanding array structure
* Understanding JavaScript objects
* Creating and using JavaScript functions
* Performing calculations using JavaScript
* Understanding and using arrow functions
* Using `for` loops


## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?
