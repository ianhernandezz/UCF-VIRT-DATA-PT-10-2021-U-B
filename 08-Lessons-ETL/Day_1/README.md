## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Create functions to avoid repeated code.
* Create lambda functions and use them to replace regular functions.
* Expand on list comprehensions by adding in conditional statements.
* Use basic regular expressions to pull apart certain text.

## How does this tie into the modules?
The activities in this class will complement Lessons **8.1.1 Extract, Transform, Load** through **8.3.9 Write Regular Expressions**.  You will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Overview of ETL
* Loading in JSON files
* Reading in CSV files
* Overview of data cleaning
* Overview of the iterative process of cleaning data
* List comprehensions
* Python functions
* Lambda functions
* Pattern matching with regular expressions

# Where in the modules can I go for assistance?
 * Working with functions and lambda functions was covered in **Lesson 8.3.4**.
 * Applying functions to the data-cleaning process was covered in **Lesson 8.3.5** through **Lesson 8.3.6**.
 * List comprehensions were covered in **Lesson 8.3.7**.
 * Applying lambda functions to the data-cleaning process was covered in **Lesson 8.3.8**.
 * Regular expressions were covered in **Lesson 8.3.9**.
