## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Use sets, wildcards, and escaping in their regular expressions
* Use special characters to grab text from the beginning and end of a text search in regular expressions
* Group their regular expressions to grab more information from their regular expression results
* Combine regular expressions and functions to make their searches more reusable.

## How does this tie into the modules?
The activities in this class will complement Lessons **8.3.9: Write Regular Expressions** through **8.3.12: Clean the Kaggle Data**.  You will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

 * Character types, sets, matching, and escaping with regular expressions
 * Grouping with regular expressions
