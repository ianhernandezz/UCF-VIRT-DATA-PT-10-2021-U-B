## Overview
This week, we will be introducing the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. In this unit, you will learn to use Python functions, list comprehensions, and regular expressions, as well as how to move data through a pipeline.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

* Create an ETL pipeline from raw data to a SQL database.
* Extract data from disparate sources using Python.
* Clean and transform data using Pandas.
* Use regular expressions to parse data and to transform text into numbers.
* Load data with PostgreSQL.
