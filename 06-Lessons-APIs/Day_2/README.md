# Module 6: Working with Google APIs

## Overview

In class, you will use the Google Maps API to plot locations on a map and create directions between multiple points.

## Learning Objectives

*By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:*

* Connect to the Google Maps API
* Use the Python library `gmaps` to plot points on a map
* Create directions between multiple points on a map

The activities in this class will complement **Lessons 6.5.1: Set Up Google Maps and Places API through 6.5.4: Map Vacation Criteria**. You will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Making API calls to the Google Maps and Places API
* Using Pandas DataFrames to store data from API calls
* Plotting with Jupyter Gmaps
* Creating Heatmaps with Jupyter Gmaps

## Where can you find information on the tasks covered in this Day_2 of APIs?
* Google Maps and Places API was covered in **Lesson 6.5.1**.
* Using Pandas with the Google Maps API was covered in **Lesson 6.5.2**.
* Nearby search and map plotting was covered in **Lesson 6.5.4**.
