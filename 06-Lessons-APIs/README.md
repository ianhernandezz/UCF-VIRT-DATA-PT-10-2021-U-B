In this module, you'll practice your analysis, visualization, and statistical skills by retrieving and analyzing weather data for a hypothetical travel company, PlanMyTrip. Successfully completing the tasks will draw on your knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics.

## What You Will Learn
By the end of this module, you will be able to: 

* Perform tasks using new Python libraries and modules.
* Retrieve and use data from an API "get" request to a server.
* Retrieve and store values from a JSON array.
* Use try and except blocks to resolve errors.
* Write Python functions.
* Create scatter plots using the Matplotlib library, and apply styles and features to a plot.
* Perform linear regression, and add regression lines to scatter plots.
* Create heatmaps, and add markers using the Google Maps API.
