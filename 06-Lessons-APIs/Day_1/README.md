# Module 6: Getting Started with APIs

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing APIS. In this unit, you will learn how to use Python to retrieve data from APIs, parse the responses, and use the data to create maps and charts.

In today's class, you will review how to use the Python request library to make requests to APIs, how to traverse JSON objects, and how to handle errors in their code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Obtain and store API keys in a config file
* Make API calls using the Python requests library
* Parse and traverse through JSON objects
* Handle errors by using try-except blocks

The activities in this class will complement lessons **6.2.1 Understanding APIs through 6.2.7 Create a DataFrame of City Weather Data** . You will benefit from these activities if they've progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Making API calls using Python's request library
* Traversing JSONs
* Using try-except blocks for error handling
* Making calls to different APIs
* Storing API data in Pandas DataFrames

## Where can you find information on the tasks covered in this Day_1 of APIs?
 * Using the Python request library to make API calls was covered in **Lesson 6.2.3**.
 * Retrieving a response and getting data were covered in **Lesson 6.2.4**.
 * Parsing JSONS was covered in **Lesson 6.2.5**.
 * Try-except blocks were covered in **Lesson 6.2.6**.
