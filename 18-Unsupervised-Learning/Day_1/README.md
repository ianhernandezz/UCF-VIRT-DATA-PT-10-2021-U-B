# Module 18 Class 1: Introduction to Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing **unsupervised machine learning**. In this unit, you will learn about unsupervised learning and how it compares to supervised learning.

In today's class, you will learn how to process and prepare data for unsupervised models. You will then be introduced to the K-means algorithm.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Understand how unsupervised learning compares to supervised learning
* Prepare and process data for unsupervised learning
* Apply K-means clustering
* Use the elbow curve to determine optimal cluster number

## How does this tie into the modules?

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **18.0.1: Using Unsupervised Learning to Discover Unknown Patterns** through **18.4.2: Use the Elbow Curve**.You will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Supervised learning recap
* Executing Python files
* Unsupervised learning: transformation and clustering
* Preparing Data
* Preprocessing data with Pandas
* Data selection
* Clustering data
* The K-means algorithm
* Finding centroids
* Elbow curves
  
## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?

 * Preprocessing data was covered in **Lesson 18.2.1** through **Lesson 18.2.6**.
 * Clustering data was covered in **Lesson 18.3.1**.
 * The K-means algorithm was covered in **Lesson 18.3.2**.
 * The elbow curve was covered in **Lesson 18.4.1**.
