# Module 18 Class 2: Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering

## Overview

In class, you will learn about dimension reduction with principal component analysis (PCA) as well as an alternative to the K-means algorithm called hierarchical clustering.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Understand how to reduce features or dimensions using PCA.
* Perform PCA on datasets.
* Use hierarchical clustering as alternative to K-means.

## How does this tie into the modules?

* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **18.5.1: Dimensionality Reduction** through **18.6.4: K-means vs. Hierarchical Clustering**.  The students will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

   * Dimensionality reduction
   * Principal component analysis
   * Mean, variance, and covariance
   * Linear transformations
   * Hierarchical clustering
   * Dendrograms
  
## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?

 * Principal component analysis was covered in **Lesson 18.5.2**.
 * Understanding hierarchical clustering was covered in **Lesson 18.6.1**.
 * Running hierarchical clustering was covered in **Lesson 18.6.3**.
 * K-means vs. hierarchical clustering was covered in **Lesson 18.6.4**.
