# Module 16 Class 1: PySpark Fundamentals

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing **Big Data**. In this unit, you will learn about big data and Spark, an engine for large-scale data processing. You will use the Python version of Spark, PySpark, to manipulate data; they will then be introduced to Cloud concepts and Amazon Web Services.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Get up and running with Google Colab Notebook
* Understand how Spark works
* Store a dataset in a PySpark DataFrame
* Filter DataFrames
* Work with dates in data and plot results


## How does this tie into the modules?
* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **16.1.1: What is Big Data?** through **16.4.3: Spark Functions**.  You will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Big data overview
* Spark architecture
* Google Colab Notebooks
* Spark DataFrames and Datasets
* Spark transformations and actions

## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?

 * Getting started with Google Colab Notebooks was covered in **Lesson 16.4.1**.
 * The basics of PySpark DataFrames were covered in **Lesson 16.4.2**.
 * Spark functions, transformations, and actions were covered in **Lesson 16.4.3**.
