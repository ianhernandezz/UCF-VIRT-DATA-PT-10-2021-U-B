# Module 15 Class 2: Statistical Analysis Using R

## Overview

You will use R to perform hypothesis testing, one-sample and two-sample t-tests, ANOVA, linear regression and multiple linear regression, and A/B testing. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use one-sample and two-sample t-tests 
* Use ANOVA 
* Perform linear and multiple linear regression

## How does this tie into the modules?

The activities in this class will complement Lessons **15.4.1: Identifying Statistical Test Types** through **15.10.1: Whose Analysis Is It Anyway?**. The students will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Testing for qualitative and quantitative normality
* Understanding skewed distributions
* Understanding and applying the null and alternative hypotheses
* Generating a sample dataset using random sampling
* Applying one-sample and two-sample t-tests
* Applying ANOVA to compare means across two or more groups
* Understanding and determining the Pearson correlation coefficient 
* Applying linear and multiple linear regression 
* Applying chi-square for categorical data
* Understanding A/B testing

## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?

  * Plotting data was covered in **Lessons 15.3.1 through 15.3.5**.
  * Hypothesis testing was covered in **Lesson 15.5.2**.
  * One-sample t-tests and two-sample t-tests were covered in **Lesson 15.6.2** and **15.6.3**.
  * ANOVA was covered in **Lesson 15.6.6**.
  * Linear regression was covered in **Lesson 15.7.2**.
