# Module 15 Class 1: The Fundamentals of R

## Overview
In today's class, you will make sure R is installed correctly, then you'll review the basics of the R programming language, create vectors, use `for` loops, use `if-else` statements, identify substrings of strings, create functions, and organize data into tibbles &mdash; R’s version of data frames.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:
 
* Verify that R and RStudio are installed correctly
* Understand the fundamentals of R programming
* Understand how to use RStudio
* Learn how to create and manipulate data in tibbles
* Compare and contrast the features of Python and R

## How does this tie into the modules?
* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **15.0.1: Using Statistics and R to Boost Your Data Science Repertoire** through **15.3.7: Add Layers to Plots**.  The students will benefit from these activities if they‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Understanding the basics of R programming
* Defining functions and using built-in functions
* Importing and reading files 
* Using indexing and slicing to filter data
* Using arithmetic, relational, and logical operators 
* Transforming, grouping, and reshaping data 
* Plotting data using `ggplot()`

## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?

  * Installing R and RStudio was covered in **Lesson 15.1.2** and **Lesson 15.1.3**.
  * The fundamentals of R programming were covered in **Lesson 15.2.1**.
  * Using the `tidyverse` package, and loading and reading in CSV files were covered in **Lesson 15.2.3**.
  * Manipulating datasets and using functions were covered in **Lesson 15.2.4** and **Lesson 15.2.5**.
