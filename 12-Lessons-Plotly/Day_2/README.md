# Module 12 Class 2: Events, D3, and GitHub Pages

## Overview

Before class, walk through this week's Challenge assignment in office hours. In class, the students will expand on their chart-building skills: they’ll have their webpages respond to events, they’ll retrieve data using `D3.json`, and they’ll deploy their work to GitHub Pages.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Add multiple traces to their plots
* Use events to dynamically change their webpage
* Use `D3.json()` to load in data from an outside source.
* Deploy a webpage to Github Pages


## How does this tie into the modules?
* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **12.3.1: Inspect an API call with D3.json()** through **12.5.1: Deploy the Project to GitHub Pages**.  You will benefit from these activities if they‘ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

   * Using multiple traces
   * Adding event listeners to their webpage
   * Retrieving data with `D3.json()`
   * Deploying to GitHub Pages

## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?
 * Using event listeners was covered in **Lesson 12.4.1**.
 * Loading in a JSON file with `D3.json()` was covered in **Lesson 12.3.2**.
 * Deploying to GitHub Pages was covered in **Lesson 12.5.1**.
