# Module 12 Class 1: Plotly Basics

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing `Plotly.js`, a JavaScript visualization library. You will learn to use Plotly and JavaScript to create an interactive data visualization for the web.

In today's class, you will use Plotly to create basic plots. Then, they will transform your plots using the JavaScript `filter()`, `map()`, `sort()`, and `slice()` methods. Finally, you will use arrow functions to shorten the syntax of their functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Create basic plots, including box and pie charts, with Plotly.
* Use the following JavaScript methods to transform their plots:
 * map
 * filter
 * slice
 * sort
* Create anonymous functions with the arrow function.

## How does this tie into the modules?
The activities in this class will complement Lessons **12.1.1: Organizing Your Tools** through **12.2.2 Practicing JavaScript Methods**.  You will benefit from these activities if you have progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:

* Creating basic plots
* Adding data to a trace object
* Using `filter()`, `map()`, and arrow functions.
* Using the `slice()` and `sort()` methods.


## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?

  * Creating basic plots was covered in **Lesson 12.1.3** and **Lesson 12.1.4**.
  * Functional JavaScript methods were covered in **Lesson 12.2.1**.
  * The `slice()` and `map()` methods were covered in **Lesson 12.2.2**.
