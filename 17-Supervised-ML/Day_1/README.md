# Module 17 Class 1: Introduction to Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This week, we will be introducing machine learning. In this unit, you will learn to prepare and transform data, split the data into training and testing sets, create a model and fit the model to the data, scale and normalize data, and then determine the performance of a machine learning model. You will also learn and use ensemble methods &mdash; combining multiple models to help improve the accuracy, robustness, and performance of the machine learning model. 
you will use scikit-learn to prepare and transform data, split the data into training and testing sets, create a model and fit the model to the data, and use linear and logistic regression to make predictions based on test data. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, you will be able to:

* Create a machine learning environment
* Prepare and transform data
* Split data into training and testing sets
* Create a model and fit the model to the data
* Perform linear and logistic regression
* Make predictions based on test data

## How does this tie into the modules?
* The activities in this class will complement Lessons **17.0.1: Predicting Credit Risk** through **17.4.2: Confusion Matrix in Practice**. You will benefit from these activities if theyâ€˜ve progressed through these lessons, which cover the following concepts, techniques, and tasks:  

* Creating a machine learning environment
* Splitting data into training and testing sets 
* Fitting the model to improve accuracy 
* Understanding and using linear and logistic regression to make predictions
* Assessing the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the model

* Note: Creating a model, fitting or training the model to the data, and then using the model to make predictions has become the standard pattern that many machine learning libraries use. This common pattern eases experimenting with new algorithms and libraries when exploring machine learning solutions. You will learn that no single correct algorithm exists for any dataset or problem &mdash; and that experimentation and validation are often preferred. You will learn to quantify and validate the performance of many models to determine the one that best suits the needs of a given dataset.

## Where in the modules can I go for assistance?

  * Overviews of supervised learning, regression was provided in **Lesson 17.2.1**, and an overview of classification was provided in and **Lesson 17.2.2**.
  * Linear regression was covered in **Lesson 17.2.3**.
  * Logistic regression was covered in **Lessons 17.2.3 - 17.3.3**.
